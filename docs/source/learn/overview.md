| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Poisson equation](poisson) | ${\color{green}Basics:}$  Poisson's equation in a unit square domain with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, as well as a source term. |
| [Linear elasticity](linear_elasticity) | ${\color{green}Basics:}$  Bending of a linear elastic beam due to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Second order tetrahedral element (TET10) is used. |
| [Hyperelasticity](hyperelasticity) | ${\color{blue}Nonlinear \space Constitutive \space Law:}$ Deformation of a hyperelastic cube due to Dirichlet boundary conditions. |
| [Plasticity](plasticity) | ${\color{blue}Nonlinear \space Constitutive \space Law:}$ Perfect J2-plasticity model is implemented for small deformation theory. |
| [Compute gradients](compute_gradients) | ${\color{red}Inverse \space Problem:}$ Sanity check of how automatic differentiation works. |
| [Topology optimization](topology_optimization) | ${\color{red}Inverse \space Problem:}$ SIMP topology optimization for a 2D beam. Note that sensitivity analysis is done by the program, rather than manual derivation. |
